# To use the project with the Vagrant Machine (for 64 bit machines)
# follow this code: 
# https://gist.github.com/3996572

# In case you are not using a Vagrant Machine, can't use a 64 bit or 
# don't have any at your disposal, just clone the repository of the project.

# git clone git@git.pagodabox.com:massive-malia.git symfony

# Please don't mix or add this repository to the UBC-CPSC 410 one. 

# From there, you can push changes to the dev branch. I can stress enough how important is 
# to use a branching model, so I'm going to describe it again. From the terminal


# $ git checkout dev
   ....  do all changes
# $ git add <files>
# $ git commit -m 
# $ git push

# You can see the changes on the dev branch here: 
# http://massive-malia.pagodabox.com/app_dev.php
 
# Please don't modify anything in the master branch, as it won't even show up. Since we are using a dev branch, 
# feature branchs won't work for persons that are not using vagrant. Otherwise, use the following model:
